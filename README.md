# International Debt Statistics Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes international debt statistics using a dataset provided by The World Bank, focusing on developing countries. The analysis aims to address several key questions regarding the debt accumulated by these nations. By exploring the data, we aim to gain insights into the overall debt burden, identify the country with the highest debt, and analyze average debt figures based on various debt indicators. Understanding these factors is crucial for evaluating how countries manage their economies and address infrastructure needs through borrowing from international organizations like The World Bank.

## Objectives

1. Examine the total debt owed by the countries in the dataset.
2. Identify the country with the highest debt amount and specify that amount.
3. Calculate the average debt amount for countries based on different debt indicators.
4. Identify the most common debt indicator.
5. Analyze the highest amount of principal repayments.
6. Draw conclusions about other viable debt issues.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from The World Bank and contains information on debt amounts, measured in USD, across various categories for developing countries.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Load the World Bank's International Debt Data

- Import the dataset and familiarize yourself with its structure and contents.

### 2. Find the Number of Distinct Countries

- Determine the number of unique countries represented in the dataset.

### 3. Find the Distinct Debt Indicators

- Identify and list the different debt indicators available in the dataset.

### 4. Total the Amount of Debt Owed by the Countries

- Calculate the total debt amount accumulated by all countries in the dataset.

### 5. Identify the Country with the Highest Debt

- Determine which country has the highest debt amount and specify that amount.

### 6. Calculate the Average Amount of Debt Across Indicators

- Analyze the average debt amount for countries based on various debt indicators.

### 7. Find the Highest Amount of Principal Repayments

- Identify the country with the highest amount of principal repayments.

### 8. Identify the Most Common Debt Indicator

- Determine which debt indicator is the most frequently occurring in the dataset.

### 9. Draw Conclusions and Explore Other Viable Debt Issues

- Summarize insights from the analysis and discuss other potential issues related to international debt.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the debt burden of developing countries and identified key factors influencing their borrowing and repayment activities. The findings can help policymakers and economists better understand international debt dynamics and inform strategies for sustainable economic development.
